        abstract: "Abstract: Private set union (PSU) has been an emerging topic in recent years due to its variety of applications. In particular, we are interested in deploying PSU in a cloud setting such that two players, the sender and the receiver, may outsource their sets to the cloud and update their sets. Later, the receiver can submit a union query to the cloud and learn the union of the sets without knowing the intersection. Of course, there is no need to restrict this scenario to only two players. A PSU operation that satisfies these properties is called updatable delegated PSU (UD-PSU). Despite the apparent usefulness of such operations, no related research, even on delegated PSU, has been conducted since Abadi et al. (TDSC 2017) posed the open problem of constructing a delegated PSU protocol. In this work, we address the above problem by presenting the first protocol for multiparty UD-PSU. Our starting point is Abadi et al.'s protocol (FC 2022) for multiparty updatable delegated private set intersection (a.k.a. Feather) built on a polynomial representation of the intersection of sets. The challenging hurdle for delegated PSU is to obtain a polynomial representation of the union of sets without revealing any information about the sets beyond the result. We develop a delegated PSU protocol by exploiting a rational polynomial representation. We then extend this basic protocol to support update operations, i.e., UD-PSU. Second, we improve the update efficiency of the resulting UD-PSU protocol to O~(nlogp), which works on polynomials of degree n over finite fields of order p. Finally, we implement our protocol in C++ and perform a comprehensive evaluation varying the cardinality of the sets and the number of players. Interestingly, the experimental results demonstrate that our protocol is comparable to Feather in overall performance. In particular, our update protocol shows an 8–12× improvement relative to Feather's update."

        abstract: "Abstract: We propose an authentication scheme for a multiagent system over integers, based on verifiable computation primitives. The naive approach, employing Freivalds' algorithm in centralized way, faces several challenges. Specifically, unreliability of the network introduces the risk of information tampering by other agents. To this end, it requires locally updating and merging the proofs of the individual states in a distributed manner. Our proposed method addresses these issues with assuming presence of a leader agent who is responsible for validating the correctness of all the states of the agents. This can be achieved by a distributed protocol that aggregates proofs from the individual agents, relying on the well-known knowledge-of-exponent assumption. By using this distributed protocol, computational complexity and communication cost are reduced compared to centralized verification. Furthermore, we incorporate a clustering technique to distribute storage requirements."

        tags: ["zkp", "snark", "pqc"],
        abstract: "Abstract: This paper addresses a new lattice-based designated zk-SNARK having the smallest proof size in the amortized sense, from the linear-only ring learning with the error (RLWE) encodings. We first generalize a quadratic arithmetic programming (QAP) over a finite field to a ring-variant over a polynomial ring Zp [X]/(XN + 1) with a power of two N. Then, we propose a zk-SNARK over this ring with a linear-only encoding assumption on RLWE encodings. From the ring isomorphism Zp[X]/(XN + 1) ≅ ZNp, the proposed scheme packs multiple messages from Zp, resulting in much smaller amortized proof size compared to previous works. In addition, we present a refined analysis on the noise flooding technique based on the Hellinger divergence instead of the conventional statistical distance, which reduces the size of a proof. In particular, our proof size is 276.5 KB and the amortized proof size is only 156 bytes since our protocol allows to batch N proofs into a single proof. Therefore, we achieve the smallest amortized proof size in the category of lattice-based zk-SNARKs and comparable proof size in the (pre-quantum) zk-SNARKs category."

        abstract: "Abstract: This paper presents a new short zero-knowledge argument for the range proof and arithmetic circuits without a trusted setup. In particular, it can achieve the shortest proof size of the proof system categories without a trusted setup. More specifically, when proving that a committed value is a positive integer less than 64 bits, except for negligible error in the 128-bit security parameter, the proof size is 576 bytes long, which is 85.7% the size of the previous shortest proof due to Bünz et al. (Bulletproofs, IEEE Security and Privacy 2018). Similarly, circuit satisfiability can be proven with less communication overhead. Nevertheless, computational overheads in both proof generation and verification are comparable with those of Bulletproofs. Bulletproofs is established as one of the important privacy-enhancing technologies for a distributed ledger due to its trustless feature and short proof size. In particular, it has been implemented and optimized in various programming languages for practical usage by independent entities since it was proposed. The essence of Bulletproofs is based on the logarithmic inner product argument with no zero-knowledge. This paper revisits Bulletproofs from the viewpoint of the first sublinear zero-knowledge argument for linear algebra due to Groth (CRYPTO 2009) and then propose Bulletproofs+, an improved variety of Bulletproofs. The main component is the zero-knowledge weighted inner product argument (zk-WIP) which enables to reduce both the range proof and the arithmetic circuit proof. It already has zero-knowledge properties, there is no additional information when reducing zk-WIP, and it incurs a minimal transmission cost during the reduction process. Note that zk-WIP has all characteristics of the inner product argument, such as an aggregating range proof and batch verification; thus, Bulletproofs+ is superior to Bulletproofs in all aspects."

        authors: "Heewon Chung, Myungsun Kim, A. Badawi, Khin Mi Mi Aung",
        conference: "Symmetry, 12(5):788, 2020",
        tags: ["fhe"],
        abstract: "Abstract: This work is mainly interested in ensuring users' privacy in asymmetric computing, such as cloud computing. In particular, because lots of user data are expressed in non-integer data types, privacy-enhanced applications built on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) must support real-valued comparisons due to the ubiquity of real numbers in real-world applications. However, as FHE schemes operate in specific domains, such as that of congruent integers, most FHE-based solutions focus only on homomorphic comparisons of integers. Attempts to overcome this barrier can be grouped into two classes. Given point numbers in the form of approximate real numbers, one class of solution uses a special-purpose encoding to represent the point numbers, whereas the other class constructs a dedicated FHE scheme to encrypt point numbers directly. The solutions in the former class may provide depth-efficient arithmetic (i.e., logarithmic depth in the size of the data), but not depth-efficient comparisons between FHE-encrypted point numbers. The second class may avoid this problem, but it requires the precision of point numbers to be determined before the FHE setup is run. Thus, the precision of the data cannot be controlled once the setup is complete. Furthermore, because the precision accuracy is closely related to the sizes of the encryption parameters, increasing the precision of point numbers results in increasing the sizes of the FHE parameters, which increases the sizes of the public keys and ciphertexts, incurring more expensive computation and storage. Unfortunately, this problem also occurs in many of the proposals that fall into the first class. In this work, we are interested in depth-efficient comparison over FHE-encrypted point numbers. In particular, we focus on enabling the precision of point numbers to be manipulated after the system parameters of the underlying FHE scheme are determined, and even after the point numbers are encrypted. To this end, we encode point numbers in continued fraction (CF) form. Therefore, our work lies in the first class of solutions, except that our CF-based approach allows depth-efficient homomorphic comparisons (more precisely, the complexity of the comparison is $O(log x+log n)$ for a number of partial quotients $n$ and their bit length $x$, which is normally small) while allowing users to determine the precision of the encrypted point numbers when running their applications. We develop several useful applications (e.g., sorting) that leverage our CF-based homomorphic comparisons."

        abstract: "Abstract: This work addresses a basic problem of security systems that operate on very sensitive information. Specifically, we are interested in the problem of privately handling numeric data represented by rational numbers (e.g., medical records). Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is one of the natural and powerful tools for ensuring privacy of sensitive data, while allowing complicated computations on the data. However, because the native plaintext domain of known FHE schemes is restricted to a set of quite small integers, it is not easy to obtain efficient algorithms for encrypted rational numbers in terms of space and computation costs. For example, the naïve decimal representation considerably restricts the choice of parameters in employing an FHE scheme, particularly the plaintext size. <br> Our basic strategy is to alleviate this inefficiency by using a different representation of rational numbers instead of naïve expressions. In this work we express rational numbers as continued fractions. Because continued fractions enable us to represent rational numbers as a sequence of integers, we can use a plaintext space with a small size while preserving the same quality of precision. However, this encoding technique requires performing very complex arithmetic operations, such as division and modular reduction. Theoretically, FHE allows the evaluation of any function, including modular reduction at encrypted data, but it requires a Boolean circuit of very high degree to be constructed. Hence, the primary contribution of this work is developing an approach to solve this efficiency problem using homomorphic operations with small degrees."
