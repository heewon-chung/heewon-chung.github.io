<p>
  I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Software Engineering at Jeonbuk National University, a position I have held since March 2025. 
  I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from Seoul National University under the supervision of Prof. Jung Hee Cheon, with a focus on fully homomorphic encryption and its practical applications.
</p>

<p>
  My research interests broadly encompass cryptography, with a particular emphasis on privacy-enhancing technologies such as secure multiparty computation, fully homomorphic encryption, and zero-knowledge proofs. 
  I am especially interested in private set operations, the theoretical foundations of blockchain security, and the design of efficient cryptographic protocols for real-world applications. 
  Additionally, I work on improving blockchain scalability by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs and verifiable computation, striving to bridge the gap between cryptographic theory and practical deployment.
</p>

<p>
  One of my notable research contributions, <strong>Bulletproofs+</strong>, was adopted by 
  <a href="https://x.com/monero/status/1558525849548251136" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #007bff;">Monero in August 2020 </a> to enhance the efficiency of confidential transactions. 
  This improvement significantly reduced transaction sizes while preserving strong privacy guarantees, marking a crucial advancement in privacy-preserving blockchain technology. 
  I continue to explore new techniques to optimize cryptographic protocols and expand their applicability across various domains.
